Description

The main focus lies on targeting party members properly with '@party' macros with the default Blizzard Frame. 

 

You don't have to set your macros with player names anymore.
You don't need group leader every match to target properly anymore.
Switching your party keybinds every match isn't also necessary anymore .
All updating problems caused by the known main script will SortGroup also try to avoid by locking down the raid frames in combat - you can change this in the options


Options

Top - Descending: You are on top of your group. Party 1-4 are sorted descending
Top - Ascending: You are on top of your group. Party 1-4 are sorted ascending
Bottom - Descending: You are on bottom of your group. Party 1-4 are sorted descending
Bottom - Ascending: You are on bottom of your group. Party 1-4 are sorted Ascending
 

Note

Deactivate 'Keep Groups Together' in your Raid Profiles
If you change any options in your Raid Profiles reload your UI.
 

Version 4.x

The main focus for this addon should lay on the sort function itself. Therefore the raid profile switch modul has been moved to the addon 'ProfileSwitcher', if you are interested in.
